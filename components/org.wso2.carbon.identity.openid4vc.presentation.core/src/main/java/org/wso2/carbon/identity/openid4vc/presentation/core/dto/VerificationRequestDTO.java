/**
 * Immutable context DTO produced by {@link PresentationSessionService#buildVerificationRequest}
 * and consumed by the verification pipeline.
 *
 * <p>Each field is required by at least one verification step:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code token} — the raw credential string (e.g. the compact SD-JWT) extracted from the
 *       vp_token map by credential query ID, handed to the verifier for parsing and signature
 *       validation.</li>
 *   <li>{@code credential} — the credential entry from the presentation definition, carrying the
 *       expected {@code vct}, format, and trusted issuer configurations used to select the correct
 *       signature validator and enforce type constraints.</li>
 *   <li>{@code expectedNonce} — the nonce issued by IS for this VP session; the verifier checks it
 *       matches the {@code nonce} claim in the KB-JWT to prevent replay attacks.</li>
 *   <li>{@code expectedAudience} — the verifier's {@code client_id} from the VP request; the
 *       verifier checks it appears in the KB-JWT {@code aud} claim.</li>
 * </ul>
